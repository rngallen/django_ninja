**Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and intuitive.
**FAST execution**: Very high performance thanks to Pydantic and async support.
**Fast to code**: Type hints and automatic docs lets you focus only on business logic.
**Standards-based**: Based on the open standards for APIs: **OpenAPI** (previously known as Swagger) and **JSON Schema**.
